## Usage

Register as a plugin in your generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(require('generate-defaults'));
  // do generator stuff
};
```

## What does this do?

- Loads the [common-middleware][] plugin
- Loads the [common-questions][] plugin
- Loads the [verb-repo-data][] plugin, to add repository data to the context
- Registers [engine-base][] as the default template engine
- Registers [template-helpers][] as the default template engine
- Registers a `check-directory` task, which prompts the user if they want to procede when a directory has files in it.

Any of these features can be overridden after this plugin is registered.
